\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

In this Section, we illustrate the formalism with a few examples.
The examples are drawn from two different applications: the estimation of Drell-Yan (DY) and $\PW$+jets backgrounds in physics analyses at the LHC
and the estimation of trigger rates for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

The DY production of lepton pairs ($\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$) and the production of $\PW$ bosons with subsequent decay to a charged lepton and a neutrino ($\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$)
constitute relevant relevant backgrounds to analyses of SM Higgs ($\PHiggs$) boson production in the decay modes $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PHiggs \to \PW\PW$
and to the production of $\PHiggs$ boson pair production in the decay modes $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW$ 
at the LHC~\cite{ATLAS:2014aga,Aad:2015vsa,Aad:2019yxi,Aaboud:2018sfw,CMS-HIG-13-004,CMS-HIG-13-027,CMS-HIG-17-002,CMS-HIG-17-006}.
Samples of simulated DY and $\PW$+jets events produced in $\Pp\Pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\TeV
have been generated at leading order (LO) and at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)
using the program \MGvATNLO~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}.
The generation of DY events is restricted to the PS region $m_{\Plepton\Plepton} > 50$~\GeV, where $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}$ denotes the mass of the lepton pair.
The samples are normalized using cross sections computed at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) accuracy in pQCD,
taking electroweak corrections up to NLO into account~\cite{Li:2012wna}.
The product of the $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ ($\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$) production cross section in the PS region $m_{\Plepton\Plepton} > 50$~\GeV
times the branching fraction for the decay of the $\PZ$ boson or virtual photon to two charged leptons (of the $\PW$ boson to a charged lepton and a neutrino) amounts to $6.11$~nb ($20.5$~nb).
We will demonstrate the stitching of these samples based on two observables,
$N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$, defined as, respectively, the number of jets and the scalar sum in $\pT$ of the jets in an event.
The PS region in which we perform the stitching will be either one- or two-dimensional.
We will show that for the formalism developed in Section~\ref{sec:stitching_weights},
it makes little difference whether the stitching is performed in one dimension or in two:
The regions in PS are enumerated by a single index $i$ in either case,
and in either case the probability $p_{i}$ follows a categorical distribution.

The task of estimating trigger rates for the upcoming high-luminosity run of the LHC represents the second type of application.
 (HL-LHC).

The second type of application is given by the


The trigger rate corresponds to the number of background events passing the trigger per second (the number of signal events is negligible)
