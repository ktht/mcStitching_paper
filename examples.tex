\section{Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

In this Section, we illustrate the formalism with a few examples.
The examples are drawn from two different applications: the estimation of Drell-Yan (DY) and $\PW$+jets backgrounds in physics analyses at the LHC
and the estimation of trigger rates for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).

The DY production of lepton pairs ($\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$) and the production of $\PW$ bosons with subsequent decay to a charged lepton and a neutrino ($\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$)
constitute relevant relevant backgrounds to analyses of SM Higgs ($\PHiggs$) boson production in the decay modes $\PHiggs \to \Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PHiggs \to \PW\PW$
and to the production of $\PHiggs$ boson pair production in the decay modes $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pbottom\Pbottom\Pgt\Pgt$ and $\PHiggs\PHiggs \to \Pbottom\Pbottom\PW\PW$ 
at the LHC~\cite{ATLAS:2014aga,Aad:2015vsa,Aad:2019yxi,Aaboud:2018sfw,CMS-HIG-13-004,CMS-HIG-13-027,CMS-HIG-17-002,CMS-HIG-17-006}.
Samples of simulated DY and $\PW$+jets events produced in $\Pp\Pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\TeV
have been generated at leading order (LO) and at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD)
using the program \MGvATNLO $2.2.2$~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}. [CHECK THAT VERSION IS CORRECT]
The generation of DY events is restricted to the PS region $m_{\Plepton\Plepton} > 50$~\GeV, where $m_{\Plepton\Plepton}$ denotes the mass of the lepton pair.
Parton showering, hadronization, and the underlying event are modeled using \PYTHIA $v8.2$ with the tune \textrm{CP5}~\cite{Sirunyan:2019dfx}.
The matching of matrix elements to parton showers is done using the \textrm{MLM} scheme~\cite{Alwall:2007fs} for the LO samples
and the \textrm{FXFX} scheme~\cite{Frederix:2012ps} for the samples simulated at NLO accuracy.
The samples are normalized using cross sections computed at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) accuracy in pQCD,
taking electroweak corrections up to NLO into account~\cite{Li:2012wna}.
The product of the $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ ($\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$) production cross section in the PS region $m_{\Plepton\Plepton} > 50$~\GeV
times the branching fraction for the decay of the $\PZ$ boson or virtual photon to two charged leptons (of the $\PW$ boson to a charged lepton and a neutrino) amounts to $6.11$~nb ($20.5$~nb).
We will demonstrate the stitching of these samples based on two observables,
$N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$, defined as, respectively, the number of jets and the scalar sum in $\pT$ of the jets in an event.
The PS region in which we perform the stitching will be either one- or two-dimensional.
We will show that for the formalism developed in Section~\ref{sec:stitching_weights},
it makes little difference whether the stitching is performed in one dimension or in two:
The regions in PS are enumerated by a single index $i$ in either case,
and in either case the probability $p^{i}$ follows a categorical distribution.

The task of estimating trigger rates for the upcoming high-luminosity run of the LHC represents the second type of application.
The ``rate'' of a trigger corresponds to the number of $\Pp\Pp$ collision events passing this trigger per unit of time, typically one second.
The estimation of trigger rates is an important task to demonstrate the physics potential of the HL-LHC.
This is because the HL-LHC physics program demands a large amount of integrated luminosity to be delivered by the LHC,
in order to allow the ATLAS and CMS experiments to perform measurements of rare signal processes,
such as the precise measurement of $\PHiggs$ boson couplings and the study of $\PHiggs$ boson pair production.
In order to accomplish its physics program, the HL-LHC is expected to operate at an instantaneous luminosity of $5$-$7.5 \times 10^{34}\cm^{-2}\s^{-1}$
at a center-of-mass energy to $\sqrt{s} = 14\TeV$~\cite{TDR_Phase2_lhc}.
The challenge of developing triggers for the HL-LHC is to design the triggers such that most of the rare signal processes pass the triggers,
whereas background processes are reduced by many orders of magnitude, in order not to exceed the limit with which events can be written to permanent storage.
The inelastic $\Pp\Pp$ scattering cross section at $\sqrt{s} = 14\TeV$ amounts to $\approx 80$~mb,
yielding up to $200$ simultaneous $\Pp\Pp$ interactions per crossing of the proton beams. 
We denote the number of these simultaneous $\Pp\Pp$ interactions by the symbol $N_{\pileup}$.
The vast majority of these interactions are inelastic proton-proton scatterings with low momentum exchange,
which arise from the exchange of gluons between the colliding protons.
These interactions are referred to as ``minimum bias interactions'' and the aggregate of up to $N_{\pileup}$ of such interactions in the same crossing of the proton beams is referred to as ``pileup''.
In order to estimate the rates of triggers at the HL-LHC,
MC samples of pure pileup events and of inelastic proton-proton scatterings with a higher momentum exchange are generated at LO in pQCD
using the program \PYTHIA $v8.2$~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}.
We denote the transverse momentum exchanged between the protons by the symbol $\pThat$.
The stitching of pure pileup samples with samples generated for different ranges in $\pThat$ allows to estimate the trigger rates with acceptable statistical uncertainties.
The scattering in which the transverse momentum exchanged between the protons equals $\pThat$ may occur in any of the $N_{\pileup}$ simultaneous $\Pp\Pp$ interactions.
Thus, the regions in PS of these $N_{\pileup}$ interactions are enumerated by a vector $I$ of dimension $N_{\pileup}$ in this case.
The $k$-th component of this vector indicates the range in $\pThat$ of the $k$-th $\Pp\Pp$ interaction.
The probability $p^{I} = p^{i_{1},\dots,i_{N_{\pileup}}}$ follows a multinomial distribution in this case.
