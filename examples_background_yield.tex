\section{Categorical probability distribution}
\label{sec:examples_background_yield}

In this Section we will discuss the case where the probability $p_{j}^{i}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:incl}) follows a categorical distribution.
The examples refer to DY and $\PW$+jets production at the LHC.
We will first discuss the stitching of $\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$ samples generated at LO accuracy in pQCD based on the observable $N_{\jet}$, 
followed by a discussion of the stitching of $\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$ samples generated at LO accuracy in pQCD based on the two observables $N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$,
before we conclude this Section with a discussion of the stitching of $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ samples generated at NLO in pQCD based on the observable $N_{\jet}$.
In all three cases, we will assume that an inclusive sample, covering the whole PS, is available.
The probabilities $p^{i}$ and $p_{j}^{i}$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:incl})
are obtained by determining the fraction of events that fall into PS region $i$ in the inclusive sample and in the exclusive samples $j$, respectively.
In case no inclusive sample is available to obtain the probabilities $p^{i}$ and $p_{j}^{i}$,
one can determine these probabilities from the ratio of cross sections computed by the MC generator.

\subsection{Stitching of $\PW$+jets samples by $N_{\jet}$}
\label{sec:WJets_vs_Njet}

In case of the $\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$ sample simulated at LO accuracy in pQCD,
the inclusive sample is stitched with samples of $N_{\jet} = 1$, $2$, $3$, and $N_{\jet} \geq 4$.
We divide the PS by the number of jets and set the index $i$ equal to $N_{\jet}$.
The number of events in each MC sample and the values of the $p^{i}$ and $p_{j}^{i}$ are given in Table~\ref{tab:samples_and_probabilities_WJets_vs_Njet}.
The corresponding stitching weights, computed according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:incl}), are given in Table~\ref{tab:weights_WJets_vs_Njet}.
The weights $w^{i}$ decrease as the number of jets increases, 
reflecting the reduction in statistical uncertainty that is achieved by using the exclusive samples in conjunction with the inclusive one.
In order to demonstrate that the stitching procedure yields background estimates that are unbiased,
we show distributions in $\pT$ of the ``leading'' and ``subleading'' jet (the jets of, respectively, highest and second-highest $\pT$ in the event),
in the multiplicity of jets and in the observable $\HT$ 
for the inclusive sample and for the sum of inclusive plus exclusive samples in Fig.~\ref{fig:controlPlots_WJets_vs_Njet}.
The distributions are normalized to an integrated luminosity of $140$~fb$^{-1}$, recorded at $\sqrt{s}=13$~\TeV.
Individual exclusive samples $j$ are distinguished by different colors.
The stitching weights $w^{i}$ computed according to Eq.~(\ref{eq:incl}) and given in Table~\ref{tab:weights_WJets_vs_Njet} are applied to the sum of inclusive plus exclusive samples.
Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\kt algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp,Cacciari:2011ma} with a distance parameter of $0.4$,
using all stable particles except neutrinos as input, and are required to satisfy the selection criteria $\pT > 25\GeV$ and $\abs{\eta} < 5.0$.
The distributions for the inclusive sample and for the sum of inclusive plus exclusive samples, with the stitching weights applied, are in agreement within the statistical uncertainties.
The exclusive samples reduce the statistical uncertainties in particular in the tails of the distributions,
which are the regions most relevant in searches for new physics.

\subsection{Stitching of $\PW$+jets samples by $N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$}
\label{sec:WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}

This example extends the previous one and demonstrates the stitching procedure based on two observables, $N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$.
The exclusive samples are simulated for jet multiplicities of $N_{\jet} = 1$, $2$, $3$, and $N_{\jet} \geq 4$ 
and for $\HT$ in the ranges $70$-$100$, $100$-$200$, $200$-$400$, $400$-$600$, $600$-$800$, $800$-$1200$, $1200$-$2500$, and $> 2500$~\GeV.
The number of events in the samples simulated in ranges in $\HT$ are given in Table~\ref{tab:samples_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}.
The information for the inclusive sample and for the samples simulated in bins of $N_{\jet}$ was given in Table~\ref{tab:samples_and_probabilities_WJets_vs_Njet} already.
The corresponding PS regions $i$, defined in the plane of $N_{\jet}$ versus $\HT$, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:regions_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}.
In total, the stitching weights $w^{i}$ are computed for $45$ separate PS regions.
The numerical values of these weights are given in Table~\ref{tab:weights_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT} in the appendix.
Distributions in $\pT$ of the ``leading'' and ``subleading'' jet,
in jet multiplicity and in the observable $\HT$ 
for the sum of inclusive plus exclusive samples are compared to the distributions obtained for the inclusive sample in Fig.~\ref{fig:controlPlots_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}.
We use the same color for all exclusive samples binned in $N_{\jet}$ and another color for all exclusive samples simulated in ranges in $\HT$,
so that one can better see where each of the two sets of samples contribute most.
Below each distribution, we show the relative statistical uncertainties for the four cases that
only the inclusive sample is used, the inclusive sample is used in conjunction with the exclusive samples binned in $N_{\jet}$,
the inclusive sample is used in conjunction with the exclusive samples simulated in ranges in $\HT$,
and for the case that all samples given in Tables~\ref{tab:samples_and_probabilities_WJets_vs_Njet} and~\ref{tab:samples_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT} are used.
As expected, the samples simulated in ranges in $\HT$ reduce the statistical uncertainties in particular in the tail of the $\HT$ distribution.
Physics analyses that search for new particles of high mass, which decay to high $\pT$ jets, are thus advised to produce MC samples in ranges in $\HT$,
whereas the samples binned in $N_{\jet}$ are particularly well suited when the signal process under study features a large number of low $\pT$ jets.

\subsection{Stitching of DY samples by $N_{\jet}$}

In case of the $\PZggx \to \Plepton\Plepton$ sample simulated at NLO accuracy in pQCD,
the inclusive sample is stitched with samples of $N_{\jet} = 0$, $1$, and $2$.
A complication arises from the fact that LHE vs matrix element jet multiplicity (before and after parton shower ?)
