  Weights $w^{i}$ for the case that inclusive and exclusive $\PW \to \Plepton\Pnu$ samples simulated at LO accuracy in pQCD
  are stitched based on the observables $N_{\jet}$ and $\HT$.
  The definition of the PS regions $i$ in the plane of $N_{\jet}$ versus $\HT$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:regions_WJets_vs_Njet_and_HT}.
